# AndroidBasics---MusicalStructureApp
 Project designed from practice sets from Udacity Android Developers course "Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program".

### What I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. 

**They include:**
 - Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
 - Creating new activities
 - Using `explicit Intents` to link between activities in your app
 - Using `OnClickListeners` to add behavior to buttons using Java code
 - Creating your own `Custom Class`
 - Looping through an `ArrayList`
 - Populating a `ListView` or `GridView` with an `ArrayAdapter`

If app include buttons, use `OnClickListener` objects. Each activity should have a `TextView` that displays the purpose of the activity, as well as buttons that will let you navigate to other activities.

**The required components for this project are:**
 - 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via `explicit intents`
 - A `custom class` storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
 - A data structure, such as an `ArrayList` that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a `ListView` or `GridView` via an `Adapter`.
